        Born in Lagny-sur-Marne, Pogba joined the youth team of Ligue 2 side Le Havre in 2007. He joined Manchester United two years later. After beginning his senior career in Manchester, limited appearances caused him to join Italian club Juventus on a free transfer in 2012, where he helped the club win four consecutive Serie A titles, two Coppa Italia titles, and two Supercoppa Italiana titles. During his time in Italy, Pogba further established himself as one of the most promising young players in the world and received both the Golden Boy award in 2013 and by the Bravo Award in 2014. Pogba was named in the 2015 UEFA Team of the Year and in the 2015 FIFA FIFPro World XI after helping Juventus to the 2015 Champions League final, their first final in twelve years.
        Pogba's performances at Juventus led to him returning to Manchester United in 2016 for a then-world record transfer fee of €105 million (£89.3 million).[4] The fee was the highest for an English club until 2021. In his first season back, he won the League Cup and the Europa League.In the 2018–19 season, he was named in the PFA Team of the Year. He rejoined Juventus in 2022, and was released by the club in 2024 after beginning an 18-month doping ban that was lifted in March 2025.In June 2025 he signed for Monaco.</p>
